*/

/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.

 */

/* Numbers- Display out number or to make calculations
Operators - Operator will perform a function between variables
String - Stores information
Boolean - true or false value
Variables - Are used to store information.
 */

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
 */ 

/* 
Variable is used store information it can be a number, boolean or string data. the variable will be used to 
perform operations within javascrpit. Which can be displayed using console.log. */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/



/* let number2

x = 12
number2 = 20 
let calculation
calculation = x + number2
console.log("Answer =" + " " + calculation) */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/
/*let x
x = 12 */


/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/*  */
/*let Name
Name = "John Doe"
console.log(Name);*/

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/ 
/*let subtraction
subtraction = x - 12; */

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 
 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are 
 lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/




/* let name1 
let name2
name1 = "john";
name2 = "John";
if (name1 !== name2) {
    console.log("Name is Different");
} else {
    console.log("Name is same");
} */

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/




/* let x1
x1 = 9
if (x1 === 1) {
  console.log ("one") ;
}
else if (x1 === 2) {
    console.log ("Two") ;
}
else if (x1 === 3) {
    console.log ("Three");
   }
else if (x1 === 4) {
    console.log ("Four");
   }
else if (x1 === 5) {
    console.log ("Five");
   }
else if (x1 === 6) {
    console.log ("Six");
   }
else if (x1 === 7) {
    console.log ("Seven");
   }
else if (x1 === 8) {
    console.log ("Eight");
   }
else if (x1 === 9) {
    console.log ("Nine");
}else if (x1 >= 10) 
 {
    console.log ("Oopss number too high");
 }
 */

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
 Upload the .js file on Eduflow before 5PM CET. In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT!
